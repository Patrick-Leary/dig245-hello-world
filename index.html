      My name is Patrick, I am a junior, and I am majoring in computer science.

      I am taking this course so that I can learn how to do front end
      development. This class will help if I ever look at "full stack"
      positions.
    </li>
    <li>
      I am a computer science major, so I have experience programming in several
      languages, but I do not have any experience in web development.
    </li>
    <li>
      My goals for this course are to learn HTML, CSS, and JS, and create a nice
      project at the end of the semester that I am proud of.

      I went through the command line activity on learn-computing, and I found
      it very interesting how much you can do in a terminal. I am used to going
      through files using file explorer rather than the command line. I also did
      not know that you can run code in it as well; I have only ever used VSCode
      for writing code. While I find this interesting, I'm not sure how often I
      will actually use the command line. After going through this, I took the
      quiz and got a 10/10, but I did have to guess on some of the questions,
      such as the one about someone's ip address. Overall, I enjoyed going
      through the activity, and I got to learn some new things.

          This was the first time I encountered anything close to AI years ago.
          The game asks you questions and has to guess what you're thinking of.
          I was always so impressed by how accurate it was, but I have not used
          it in years. I played it again, and it guessed correctly.

          I enjoyed playing through some of this game, and I was impressed when
          I got to the part where you have to put in today's Wordle answer. I
          wonder what will happen if Wordle is shut down? Will the game use the
          last Wordle answer, or will it break the game?

          I loved looking through this website an seeing the absolute scale of
          the universe. I also like that there is a sidebar that you can use to
          control the volume and look at the credits. While the other two
          websites that I looked at are fun games, this website is much more
          impressive with its visuals.

<!-- Going through the websites and then finding and adding images took a little while. It wasn't necearily
hard, it just took some time. Also, going through and making it look a bit nicer took some time.-->
