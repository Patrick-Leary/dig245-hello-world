        <li>
          My name is Patrick, I am a junior, and I am majoring in computer science
        </li>
        <li>
          I am taking this course so that I can learn how to do front end development.
          This class will help if I ever look at "full stack" positions
        </li>
        <li>
          I am a computer science major, so I have experience programming in several
          languages, but I do not have any experience in web development.
        </li>
        <li>
          My goals for this course are to learn HTML, CSS, and JS, and create a nice project at the end 
          of the semester that I am proud of.

          I went through the command line activity on learn-computing, and I found it very interesting 
          how much you can do in a terminal. I am used to going through files using file explorer rather 
          than the command line. I also did not know that you can run code in it as well; I have only ever 
          used VSCode for writing code. After going through this, I took the quiz and got a 10/10. However, 
          I did have to guess on some of the questions, such as the question about someone's ip address. 
          Overall, I enjoyed going through the activity, and I was about to learn some new things.
