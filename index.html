      My name is Patrick, I am a junior, and I am majoring in computer science
    </li>

      I am taking this course so that I can learn how to do front end
      development. This class will help if I ever look at "full stack" positions
    </li>
    <li>
      I am a computer science major, so I have experience programming in several
      languages, but I do not have any experience in web development.
    </li>
    <li>
      My goals for this course are to learn HTML, CSS, and JS, and create a nice
      project at the end of the semester that I am proud of.

      I went through the command line activity on learn-computing, and I found
      it very interesting how much you can do in a terminal. I am used to going
      through files using file explorer rather than the command line. I also did
      not know that you can run code in it as well; I have only ever used VSCode
      for writing code. After going through this, I took the quiz and got a
      10/10. However, I did have to guess on some of the questions, such as the
      question about someone's ip address. Overall, I enjoyed going through the
      activity, and I was about to learn some new things.

                This was the first time I encountered anything close to AI years ago. I was always so impressed 
                by how accurate it was, but I have not used it in years. I wonder if it has improved even more.
